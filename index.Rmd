### About

I received a BA in Public Health Studies and Earth & Planetary Sciences from Johns Hopkins University in 2014, an MHS in Environmental Health Sciences from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://ehe.jhu.edu/) in 2015, and my PhD in Environmental Health Sciences from the Climate and Health Program (now the [Center for Climate and Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/center-climate-health)) at Columbia University, under the mentorship of Drs. [Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/marianthi-anna-kioumourtzoglou) and [Patrick Kinney](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/patrick-kinney/).<br>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/), under the supervision of Drs. [Itai Kloog](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/itai-kloog2) and [Maayan Yitshak-Sade](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/maayan-yitshak-sade). I am also an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, teaching in the [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.qmss.columbia.edu/) (QMSS) program, and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Barnard College, teaching in the [Department of Environmental Science](https://envsci.barnard.edu/).<br>

My research interests can be largely divided into three areas. First, I am interested in the health effects of air pollution in low- and middle-income countries, where such studies are currently still lacking. Second, I utilize existing satellite data for air pollution health studies, particularly in the assessment of the sensitivity of epidemiologic studies to exposure model choice. Third, I am interested in studying the effects of climate change on air pollution, quantifying the health impacts of climate changed-induced air pollution in China and the United States.<br>

Recently, my work has been focused more on air pollution exposure modeling and ensemble-based modeling approaches. Current projects include evaluating policy impacts of air pollution levels in New York City (see a recent interview [here](https://therivernewsroom.com/climate-health-human-health-air-quality-new-york/)) and building a fine-scale NO~2~ model over Mexico City. My CV is available [here](cv_he.pdf).<br>

Outside of research, I am an avid opera/oratorio singer and classical music enthusiast. More info can be found in the [Performances](https://mikezhe.com/performances.html) and [Repertoire](https://mikezhe.com/repertoire.html) tabs. <br><br>
