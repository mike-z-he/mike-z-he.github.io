### About
I received a BA in Public Health Studies and Earth & Planetary Sciences from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2014 and an MHS in Environmental Health Sciences from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://ehe.jhu.edu/) in 2015. I am currently a fifth-year doctoral student in Columbia's [Climate and Health Program](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/climate-and-health-program), under the mentorship of Drs. [Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mk3961) and [Patrick Kinney](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/patrick-kinney/).<br>

My research interests can be largely divided into three areas. First, I am interested in the health effects of air pollution in developing countries, where such studies are currently still lacking. Recently, I have become increasingly involved in utilizing existing satellite data for air pollution health studies, particularly in the assessment of the sensitivity of epidemiologic studies to exposure model choice. Lastly, I am interested in studying the effects of climate change on air pollution, quantifying the health impacts of climate changed-induced air pollution in China and the United States. My CV is available [here](cv_he.pdf).<br><br>
